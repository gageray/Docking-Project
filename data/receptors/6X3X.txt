PubMed Abstract: 
Most general anaesthetics and classical benzodiazepine drugs act through positive modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA ) receptors to dampen neuronal activity in the brain . However, direct structural information on the
mechanisms of general anaesthetics at their physiological receptor sites is lacking. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of GABA receptors bound to intravenous anaesthetics, benzodiazepines and inhibitory modulators. These
structures were solved in a lipidic environment and are complemented by electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations. Structures of GABA receptors in complex with the anaesthetics phenobarbital, etomidate and propofol reveal bo…
