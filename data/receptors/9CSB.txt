PubMed Abstract: 
Type A GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptors (GABA receptors) mediate most fast inhibitory signalling in the brain and are targets for drugs that treat epilepsy, anxiety, depression and insomnia and for anaesthetics . These receptors
comprise a complex array of 19 related subunits, which form pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The composition and structure of native GABA receptors in the human brain have been inferred from subunit localization in tissue , functional
measurements and structural analysis from recombinant expression and in mice . However, the arrangements of subunits that co-assemble physiologically in native human GABA receptors remain unknown. Here we isolated α1 subunit-…
