the recetpors need to be aligned if there is no ligand.
infact, there should probably be a single ligand selected as the absolute one.  the anti benzo one
the rotation script will need to be sent the recetpor, its metadata, and the metadata for the ligand receptor
take args 3 and pdb and 2 json
parse the json so you get the position and use that.... just any for them so order doesnt matter?  it can tell whats what after.  just verify pdb and one json for ligand ones and pdb and 2 json for the non ligand ones
just check json for the first one of the args to have not null for bzd site location
use that for the same math you do to rotate the ligand receptor.
that should produce the same result.
